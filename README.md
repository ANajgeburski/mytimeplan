# Introduction

I think I covered all of the requirements presented in the task. I did not encounter any major problems, 
except that planning and configuring everything in blank project took me longer than I estimated. 
Taking into consideration smaller issues, I have spent some time figuring out how to add id field 
to the Star without adding said field to this class directly.
Also deciding which approach should I take with error handling took me a moment
because Spring Boot offers quite a few options.
